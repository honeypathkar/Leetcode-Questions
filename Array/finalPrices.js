/* 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop
Acceptance Rate: 80.8% */

/* Test Case:
input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Expected output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all. */
