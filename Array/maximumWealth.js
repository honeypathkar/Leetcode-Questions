/* 1672. Richest Customer Wealth
Acceptance Rate: 88.3% */

/* Test Case:
input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Expected output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6. */
